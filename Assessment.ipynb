In this regards, Microsoft Co-pilot can be used through university Microsoft accounts to help in coming up with ideas, inspiration or general framework, as well as being an assistive tool in debugging the codes, but the final work you submit needs to be your own original work and you need to take the full responsibility of the submission originality. In case the suggested assistive AI tool is used, please provide the list of prompts in the disclaimer section at the bottom this notebook for future references."

Construct other models with different numbers of hidden layers each with 20 neurons per layer (for example: 1,2,4,6 layers).
